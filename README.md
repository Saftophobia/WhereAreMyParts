# Where are my parts - A.I Project - 1
Where are my parts is a game where the goal is to assemble broken robot.

The broken robot parts are scattered around the grid. They can only move in 2D directions, till they hit an obstacle, another part, or the border of the grid and die. 

Thenceforth, search algorithms were used to efficiently assemble the Robot with least possible cost. \\

Thus, the idea of the project is assemble the robot efficiently using Search Algorithms.

###### Search Algorithms
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search
* Greedy Search
* A* Search ( 2 different Heuristics Implemented )

##### Why?
* Graded Project, part of the Artificial Intelligence course.
